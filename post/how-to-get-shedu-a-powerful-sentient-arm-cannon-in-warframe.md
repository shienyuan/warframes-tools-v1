excerpt: Shedu is a Sentient style arm-cannon featuring high critical chance and critical multiplier. It Fires Heat damage bullets, which produces a 6.6 meter radius explosion with electric damage after hitting the ground or an enemy. After the magazine is completely exhausted, it can generate a 20-meter pulse. The enemy within the range will be affected by impact status, and it can also remove Sentient's damage resistance.

## How to get Shedu in-game?

Players can get the main weapon blueprint after the completion of 
[Erra quest](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Erra_(Quest)). If you accidentally sell the blueprint, you can buy it from the 
[Cephalon Simaris](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Cephalon_Simaris) for 100,000 reputations.

Shedu's components are rare drops of the [Symbilysts](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Symbilyst)(
[Sentient Anomalies](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Murex)), 
which can be found in the [Veil Proxima](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Veil_Proxima) during 
[Empyrean missions](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Empyrean). This ship appears every 30 minutes (refresh at 0 and 30 minutes every hour) and 
randomly occupy a node for 30 minutes. The node will have a flashing red light, indicated by the Sentient faction logo. Weapon parts can be traded between players.
