excerpt: Protea, the combat engineer, should be reborn and bloom again, travelling through the borrowed time to devise her strategy. Deploy fragmentation grenades around to destroy enemies, or restore shields to resist attacks. Under the focus of the laser, a turret firing plasma bullets were deployed to launch an attack and burn the enemy to ashes. Use the supply aircraft to protect yourself from severe damage, draw strength from the past, and protect the future counterattack. Protea was released in Warframe update 28.0.0.
