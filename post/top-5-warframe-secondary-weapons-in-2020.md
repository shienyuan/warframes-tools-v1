excerpt: Secondary weapons in Warframe is always a debatable topic, many players tend to focus on their 
    primaries and melee weapons, especially for newer players often get confused thinking secondary weapons 
    are useless which is a big misunderstanding.

Indeed, secondary weapons are not used often comparing to primaries and melees, but just like any weapons in Warframe they all have its advantages and disadvantages when your primary or melee is bad at or simply not usable in some situations is where your secondary weapon shines and vice versa. For a simple example, you are equipping a primary shotgun that normally has a short-range, on missions that need precise aiming often equipping a secondary weapon like pistol or bow can guarantee your rate of succession. 

Below is a list of top 5 secondary weapons in Warframe that I think are great and nice to have, just like I wrote in other weapon recommendation articles, every weapon on the list is opinionated at the end of the day it all comes down to your personal preference, but do consider have all three weapons with different specialities to further support you in different situations.
