excerpt: There are currently 257 primary weapons in-game, it's hard for players to decide which weapon is 
    "good", and most importantly which weapon worth the time to use Forma(add, remove, alter weapon mod 
    slot polarity) and installing an Orokin Catalyst(increase weapon mod capacity).

There's no such weapon as the best weapon in Warframe it all comes down to your personal preference. The strength and use of your mods also heavily affect weapon performance. The hardest part is when it comes to Forma which takes a lot of time to level up the weapon and alter its mod polarities and Orokin Catalyst is never an easy item to obtain, but if you decided to use Platinums then there are no such hassles.

Enough of introduction, let's get down to the list of primary weapons that I think is great and good to have. Be aware that the following weapons I recommend are heavily opinionated, you should always choose the weapon that fits your playstyle. Sorry if your favourite weapon is not on the list.

to fight your way through the galaxy.
